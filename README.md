⚡ Rushabh’s Portfolio — Welcome to My Nerd Cave 😎

This is my fancy neon-glowing, animated, “hire me I’m cool” portfolio.
Built to show that I code, I create, and yes — I vibe. ✨

If you’re here, either:

✔ You’re stalking me 👀
✔ You clicked the wrong link
✔ You want to see what I can do 🤷‍♂️

Either way — enjoy.

🤓 What’s Inside?

✨ Big name text that screams “I am here.”
✨ Skills that actually work.
✨ Projects that do more than “Hello World.”
✨ Buttons you can click (yes, they work).
✨ A contact section so you can say hi — or offer me work 👀
